A car used 12 gallons of gasoline and traveled a total distance of 290 miles. The car’s fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon on the highway and 20 miles per gallon in the city. The variable h will represent the number of gallons used on the highway. Which equation could be used to find h?
.25h + 20(12 - h) = 290
-25(12 - h) + 20h = 290
-25(12 + h) + 20h = 290
-25h + 20(12 + h) = 290
